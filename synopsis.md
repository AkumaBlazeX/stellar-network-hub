## Problem Statement (200 words)

The digital landscape is rapidly evolving, with social media becoming an integral part of modern communication and networking. However, existing social media platforms often suffer from complexity, privacy concerns, and resource-intensive operations that limit accessibility and user experience. EchoMateLite addresses these challenges by providing a lightweight, secure, and scalable social media solution.

The core problem lies in creating a social media platform that balances simplicity with functionality while ensuring robust cloud deployment, secure user authentication, and seamless user experience. Traditional social media platforms are often over-engineered with unnecessary features that complicate the user interface and increase development complexity. Additionally, many platforms lack proper security measures and scalable architecture, leading to performance issues and security vulnerabilities.

EchoMateLite solves these problems by implementing a streamlined, cloud-native architecture that prioritizes essential social networking features while maintaining high performance and security standards. The platform eliminates the complexity barrier by focusing on core functionalities: user authentication, profile management, and post creation/viewing. This approach ensures that users can engage in meaningful social interactions without being overwhelmed by excessive features, while developers benefit from a clean, maintainable codebase deployed on reliable AWS infrastructure.

## Key Features / Expected Results (500 words)

### Core Features Implementation:

**User Authentication System**: The platform implements a robust authentication system using AWS Cognito, providing secure user registration, login, and session management. Users can create accounts with email verification, reset passwords securely, and maintain persistent sessions across devices. The authentication system integrates seamlessly with the frontend React application, providing a smooth user experience while maintaining enterprise-grade security standards.

**Profile Management System**: Users can create and customize their profiles with essential information including display names, profile pictures, and biographical details. The profile management feature allows users to upload profile images to S3 storage, edit their information in real-time, and view other users' profiles. The system ensures data consistency across the platform while providing intuitive profile editing capabilities.

**Post Creation and Viewing**: The core social networking functionality enables users to create text-based posts with optional image attachments. Posts are stored in DynamoDB with proper indexing for efficient retrieval and display. The feed system displays posts from all users in chronological order, with real-time updates and smooth scrolling experience. Users can view individual posts and access post details through a clean, responsive interface.

**Content Management**: The platform includes comprehensive content management capabilities, allowing users to upload images for posts and profile pictures. Images are processed and stored in S3 buckets with CloudFront CDN integration for fast global delivery. The system supports multiple image formats and implements proper file size validation and optimization.

**Real-time Feed Updates**: The feed system provides real-time updates of new posts, ensuring users always see the latest content. The implementation uses efficient database queries and caching strategies to maintain fast response times even as the user base grows.

### Technical Architecture Features:

**Serverless Backend**: The platform utilizes AWS Lambda functions for all backend operations, ensuring automatic scaling and cost optimization. Four main Lambda functions handle posts, users, connections, and file uploads, providing modular and maintainable code structure.

**API Gateway Integration**: All client-server communication is routed through AWS API Gateway, providing secure endpoints for authentication, profile management, and post operations. The API Gateway handles request validation, rate limiting, and CORS configuration.

**Database Management**: DynamoDB serves as the primary database with three main tables: users, posts, and connections. The database design ensures fast query performance and supports the platform's scalability requirements.

**Content Delivery Network**: CloudFront CDN is integrated for static asset delivery, including profile pictures and post images, ensuring fast loading times globally.

### Expected Results:

**User Experience**: Users will experience a smooth, responsive interface with fast loading times and intuitive navigation. The platform will support concurrent users without performance degradation, providing a professional social networking experience.

**Security Compliance**: The platform will implement industry-standard security measures, including encrypted data transmission, secure user authentication, and proper access control mechanisms.

**Scalability**: The serverless architecture will automatically scale to handle varying user loads, ensuring consistent performance during peak usage periods.

**Cost Efficiency**: The AWS serverless approach will minimize infrastructure costs while maintaining high availability and performance standards.

**Monitoring and Maintenance**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring will enable proactive issue detection and resolution, ensuring platform reliability and user satisfaction.

## Preliminary Findings on the likely AWS services to be used (200 words)

Based on comprehensive research and analysis of EchoMateLite's requirements, the following AWS services have been identified as optimal for supporting the project's objectives:

**AWS Lambda** serves as the core compute service, providing serverless execution for all backend operations. Lambda's automatic scaling, pay-per-use pricing, and seamless integration with other AWS services make it ideal for handling user authentication, profile management, and post operations without managing server infrastructure.

**Amazon DynamoDB** is selected as the primary database due to its serverless nature, automatic scaling capabilities, and seamless integration with Lambda functions. DynamoDB's NoSQL structure efficiently handles user profiles, posts, and connection data while providing fast query performance and built-in backup capabilities.

**AWS Cognito** provides comprehensive user authentication and authorization services, including user registration, login, password recovery, and session management. Cognito's integration with API Gateway ensures secure access to all platform features while maintaining compliance with security best practices.

**Amazon S3** with CloudFront CDN handles all file storage requirements, including profile pictures and post images. S3's durability and CloudFront's global content delivery ensure fast, reliable access to user-generated content worldwide.

**API Gateway** manages all client-server communication, providing secure RESTful endpoints with built-in request validation, rate limiting, and CORS support. This service ensures consistent API access patterns and simplifies frontend integration.

**CloudWatch** provides comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities, enabling real-time performance tracking, error detection, and operational insights for maintaining platform reliability and user experience quality.
